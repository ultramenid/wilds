                <p>We are busy at work finalising our guide that explains the diverse types of harm caused by illegal wildlife trade (IWT), and how pioneering civil lawsuits can be developed to help provide remedies. 
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Civil lawsuits represent a breakthrough in environmental law, and a novelty among efforts to tackle illegal trade. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on punishing perpetrators of ITW this strategy refocuses efforts onto remedying the harm caused by IWT. The guide will explain how these lawsuits can be developed, addressing technical and legal challenges, in order to support biodiversity conservation and strengthen access to justice.

This online, global course will explore the challenges and opportunities associated with conservation in Indonesia. It will include a virtual tour, a workshop on natural history illustration, and talks by Indonesian and international lecturers, NGOs, and government parties.

Jacob explains, "His work serves not only to bring justice in individual cases, but has inspired a vision of what is possible in Indonesia—a future in which courts are true centres of evidence-based justice, even in the face of entrenched interests; where academics are genuine public servants, and in which science has a prominent role in the public discourse."</p>
